    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founded by Fred Mouawad, the first Pizza Corner opened in Chennai, India in 1996. By 2004, Mouawad had bought out the shares held by his equity partners and formed the Global Franchise Architects. It operated over 100 restaurants and delivery outlets in five countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar, and Thailand. As with all GFA brands, Pizza Corner utilizes the services of its partners under the Synergia One Group: Synova Foods, for its product development and production and Itorama which manages GFA's restaurant designs, advertising and website development.

        In 1998, Pizza Corner launched the Food for Good program in association with the Don Bosco Yuva Kendra as part of the initiative to help provide education to 20 deserving street children in Bangalore, India. </p>
